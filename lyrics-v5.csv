trainee
in many ways, this term defines my existence
but at the same time it is a term that i can never truly explain
a period of time, a state of transition
where i could neither belong anywhere
nor do anything
the biggest concerns i had living as a trainee
were the questions of friends and family
""when are you going to come out?""
""when are you going to debut?""
questions like these
i couldn’t give them an answer
because i didn’t know either
because such answers were unknowable
though i came here through a certain confidence
and belief in myself
what awaited me was a different kind of reality:
even now, after three years have passed
even as i occasionally gain the self-certainty to think things like
“once i debut, i will conquer the music industry”
whenever i hear the criticisms of the producers and teachers
i am again overwhelmed by the realization that i am nothing
that i am as inconsequential as a speck of dust
it’s as if though before me lies the bluest ocean
and if i turn to look back
a vast desert awaits me
in this hourglass-like mindset
in this mood
i spent my three years as a trainee
and now, my debut is finally drawing near
even after i debut
new oceans and new deserts will likely await me

letting myself go to the innocent dreams
my childhood days was impatient to be an adult

it’s different from what you’ve dreamed of when you were little but we have met, we’re heroes, rappers in training
now jump to the stage, we are the new generation heroes
seven heroes-in-training, who were once immature, making a jump sound
instead of a trampoline, the place i need to jump on is the stage, crazily, up down
now don’t just talk about it, it’s time to spread my wings and go, let’s get it started
spread your shoulders, rock your body, empty your head, let’s go party

hip hop persists in me
and completely turns me inside out

my 16 bars on the corner of my textbooks

and went to a studio in namsan-dong, daegu
all night, i sharpened my blunt pen tip
at the end of my efforts
instead of having a language marks for school
i filled up my rhymes

i’m not a pre-schooler but why is everything so childish?
look at my eyes, my jokes aren’t serious
saying this is so hard, i like you
i was too shy to become your sun so i became a cold moon
but afterwards, i keep making a wave of blankets on top of my ocean bed
i jump around like a crazy guy
winning over my embarrassed feelings with some ufc moves
with a high kick and a jab and a hook
with some pounding, i let it all out in my blanket
oh gimme an iron so i can smooth out my hands and feet
you have already made it into several lines of my lyrics
it’s even more than that, but my poor blanket
i just wish you were here

i’m not a pencil but i keep getting dark thoughts toward you
did you notice my dark thoughts?
i try to hide it but i can’t, it’s just useless efforts
time goes tick tock and when i’m in front of your house
i try to set the mood
this time, i’ll really pretend i’m crazy
and give you a deep kiss so i grab your shoulders
but then the phone rings
your dad asks when you’re coming back home

before i sleep, i get angry at my blanket again
it was so good…

should i do it or not? then i did it
making jokes and playing around, getting physical and acting cute

i remember how we came here three years ago
when you and i used to fight all the time
the wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
back then i thought this was a big place
but my ambition grew too big
that big house became too small now
when the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
good things were always other people’s things
we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
let’s not forget those things but put them away
this place smells like us
let’s not forget this scent, wherever we are
we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

let’s move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let’s move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

three years felt so short but so long
a lot of things happened, there were many memories
i remember now that we’re about to leave
traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
as much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
maybe that’s why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
even the dust will be cleared now
there’s more stuff than the beginning, i have more than when i started too
now let’s take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
a new start, a new beginning
excited to see how it will become
move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
after you’re done, let’s get a bowl of black bean noodles, that’s right

let’s move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let’s move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

ever since i was born
i counted the days for my first move
i remember, why i had to move
the machine in my mom’s heart and the big scar
in winter of 2010 at daegu
the childish me used to measure the size of the world
the reason why we moved into a business
was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
so moving left many things with me
whether i liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
my life was about paying rent, i know
i lived with my pride put into the down payment
so i’m gonna move again
i’m gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
when will i stop having to move again?
i hope it comes quickly

makes them so gravely lonely that they quietly shut their mouths
of course i don’t care what‘s the matter or what i’ve now become
when loneliness is the only thing that stays by my side
i’ve become completely alone. it's a lock that fills sadness
someone says, “bastard, you’ve become a celebrity”

breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends

i become sick with worry, the sticker always beneath my ear
never end… why is there no end and always hell?

  exactly, the leader suffers so much
  leader-hyung suffering, (mumble mumble)
  i'm sorry, i think i'm the wrong
  i'm sorry we're (v & jimin) are same age friend as well, ugh
  yeah, things are hard for me these days, ah my shoulders hurt
  we've finished now
  is your shoulder right?
  ah, i don't know
  wow, i almost feel asleep while washing up
  i don't know why but i feel like that is possible
  yeah, you did that the other time
  hey, but kids
  just like sitting on the ground or something
  when i saw before v looked like he was going to die maybe that's why he wasn't singing?
  but i surprisingly get a lot of motivation support from v-hyung
  quit it
  lol
  ah, seriously stop being like that
  yeah you looked like you were having a rough time
  ah i said stop it
  you must have had such a hard time
  ah! seriously!
  not doing the dance properly as well
   yeah
  but seriously today ''i need u'' was so great
  dope! dope! it was awesome!
  oh yeah dope! dope was the best
  okay, yeah, they're all great but, don't you think ""danger"" was a killer?
  danger
  okay, but with ''i need u'', i can't even imagine how would it have been like if the ''i need u girl'' bit wasn't in it
everyone sings along to it, ''i need u girl'' you know that bit
  suga-hyung wasn't even like rapping at the beginning
  yeah, yeah, suga wasn't
  suga-hyung wasn't rapping at all
  he was just like holding the microphone
  suga-hyung was just doing stuff like this
  hey hey hey, i'll just say one thing
  he's really just half-assing it
  please just piss off
  lol
  if you don't even want to do that
  you just wanted to say that didn't you?
  that means that your voice didn't come out in ''i need u''
  it came out well, that's for sure
  i felt good, though, to be honest when suga-hyung didn't rap but everyone sang along anyway
  okay but imagine this
  there were so many people there as well and it just felt so good
  we just opened our eyes but we're practicing for ''no more dream'' in the training room, how would you feel?
  no, no, i'm not going back
  no them, i'm just to go down a different path
  yep okay, you do down another road
  that's it, you are doing ''no more dream'' right now only eating chicken breast
  no no no no, i can't
  you are with that cold argilla chicken breast
  seriously the manager-hyung. what about the scene where you secretly tried to have salt with the chicken breast and got
caught?
  oh no, no no no no
  my perm hair
  like seriously, this is just like all a dream and ''i need u''.  ''i need u '' is all a dream
  but seriously
  but sometimes it does seem like a dream
  but it's not just that
  don't say things like that!
  back in the day i used to eat world cone but now i'm doing world tours
  ah fainting, ugh okay
  what is that
  your sense of humor had significantly dropped
  these things get cut out immediately
  with one song
  okay but seriously, this could all be a dream, like to be honest there were lots of artists that did well in korea
  that's true
  i always think you should do well with one song first then go further but i'm a little bit anxious because it's not like our title song has come out yet or anything
  that's true
  ah this kid has a talent in bringing down the mood
  suddenly... it's almost like the titanic
  yep
  right before it sinks
  it's been overthrown
  ah, yoongi-hyung just happens to say something like this, really bursts the bubble
  i know right
  ""the title hasn't even come out yet''
  i know right, ''the title songs hasn't even... ''
  no wait! okay, so the title just has to come out well, right?
  yeah
  yeah then just like make it well, huh? release it and boom it will be a hit again. so easy amirite?
  lol
  hey you should just go to bed
  yeah, you suit being asleep better
  you usually don't say anything
  at this point i want to ask hobi, say something about your expectations for our music this time round
  hobi, what do you think?
  i think we'll do well
  lol
  noo
  lol shut up shut up you guys are so loud
  yeah we're not going to do well
  but kids, our youth is bright
  oh ya
  when we go to korea! bang-pd-nim will have prepared incredible tracks for us
and us? we just have to add our talent on the top of it!
  why are you being like this?

i remember how we came here three years ago
when you and i used to fight all the time
the wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
back then i thought this was a big place
but my ambition grew too big
that big house became too small now
when the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
good things were always other people’s things
we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
let’s not forget those things but put them away
this place smells like us
let’s not forget this scent, wherever we are
we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

let’s move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let’s move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

three years felt so short but so long
a lot of things happened, there were many memories
i remember now that we’re about to leave
traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
as much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
maybe that’s why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
even the dust will be cleared now
there’s more stuff than the beginning, i have more than when i started too
now let’s take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
a new start, a new beginning
excited to see how it will become
move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
after you’re done, let’s get a bowl of black bean noodles, that’s right

let’s move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let’s move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

ever since i was born
i counted the days for my first move
i remember, why i had to move
the machine in my mom’s heart and the big scar
in winter of 2010 at daegu
the childish me used to measure the size of the world
the reason why we moved into a business
was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
so moving left many things with me
whether i liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
my life was about paying rent, i know
i lived with my pride put into the down payment
so i’m gonna move again
i’m gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
when will i stop having to move again?
i hope it comes quickly

the fact that no matter how much they shout, it won’t reach
makes them so gravely lonely that they quietly shut their mouths
of course i don’t care what‘s the matter or what i’ve now become
when loneliness is the only thing that stays by my side
i’ve become completely alone. it's a lock that fills sadness
someone says, “bastard, you’ve become a celebrity”
oh fuck that! so what?! nobody remains by my side and i'm fine on my own

my hurt is water and oil that can’t mix
so only above the surface of the water do i
breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends

i want to make it known too
my value, everyday
i become sick with worry, the sticker always beneath my ear
never end… why is there no end and always hell?
as time goes by, it’s a neverland in a cold abyss!
but i always think, now
even if i sleep a shrimp’s sleep, my dreams are like that of a whale’s
the upcoming big praise will make me dance everyday

J-Hope: Ahhhh~
Jungkook: Me
J-Hope: Me (RM laughs) I�m raising my hand slowly!
Jungkook: Honestly, I didn�t know anything about music back then
Jimin: For me, I knew Billboard but I didn't even know what Grammy was
RM: That's understandable, but since Billboard has a chart I thought it was a good thing, so I was supporting it
Jimin: I thought there was a singer named �Grammy�; I kept hearing Grammy mentioned with music. That�s why I thought Grammy was a singer!
RM: We�re such noobs, aren�t we?
Jimin: Aye, it was a long time ago
Suga: That was 7�8 years ago
RM: I said this in an interview before, when we were waiting... Hobi and I... we were� what was it? We went to the (beeped out) store. We sat down and talked like a year before debut.
Jimin: Do you remember?
J-Hope: Of course I remember

RM: Something like that. Anyway, we were eating-
J-Hope: That time, I really didn�t even know if it was going in my mouth or nose
RM: We talked about if we would even be able to debut for a long time.

J-Hope: We were nervous
Jimin: Namjoon-hyung always said things like that
Jin: That�s right

Jungkook: We both fell asleep in the same way (Laughter)
Jin: J-Hope and I only played in Chinese class (Laughter)
J-Hope: That was a really long time ago
RM: I didn�t think we�ll get to debut, even after the year we debuted
Suga: I... I even got injured at that time, I didn�t think I�d debut
RM: To be honest, we are the only ones that received an award at the show as a K-Pop group
J-Hope: True
V: True

RM: I�m not saying we should boast, but to be honest it is a huge success. That�s what I think. But because of that, I keep wondering - To what point, how far we need to go up. Like we go really far up. For example, the video in front of us, won�t it be replayed forever? Like in 10 years, we'll go on reality shows and they�ll play that video and ask how we felt over and over again. After experiencing that, it makes me nervous honestly. It makes me wonder how far we might fall down.
J-Hope: Ow... Yeah
Suga: Me too, me too. I relate so much because the hardest thing for me is that going up is going up. We worked hard to come up to where we are.
V: I don�t like that
Suga: But compared to that, won�t falling down happen so quickly? I worry about that a lot.
RM: Hmm, that�s what I�m saying
Jin: It�s like when you meet someone for the first time and you have that kind of excitement - feelings of nervousness and worry of what this person is going to be like. Isn�t it similar?
RM: First meeting kind of feeling?
Jin: Yeah, first meeting
J-Hope: What are you saying suddenly? (Laughs)
Jungkook: Yeah, hyung I think you really�
Jin: Did I go too far?
J-Hope: We have to settle this today (Jimin laughs)
Jin: Ah, I�m nervous for today (Chattering)
J-Hope: We have to play a game today
Jungkook: I think I know what you�re talking about
Jin: Yeah so if you understand, quickly make the mood or something yeah? (Laughter)
Jungkook: Sing a song!
Jin: Yeah

V: (Sings) �They tell me to come� (Sings A Typical Trainee�s Christmas) (Laughter and chattering)

J-Hope: Ahh that�s right
Jimin: I couldn�t even get lessons, so I just watched
Jin: Jimin joined really late

V: When Jimin couldn�t get lessons, he came to one of my lessons
Jimin: What?
V: When I was having lessons
Jimin: Vocal?
V: Yeah
Jungkook: Observer, observer
V: He was just observing that time and I thought I would show him a cool side of myself. All I did was �Doomba, doomba, doomba� (Laughter)
Jimin: Seriously, all he did was that for hours �Doom, doom, doom� (Jin laughs) He did that the whole time and ended
V: Ahh, I wanted to show him how cool I was
RM: That kind of feeling in those Chinese martial art films, they make you clean for 3 years
Jin: Ah that�s right, that�s right... You went to the kitchen and washed the dishes for 3 years
RM: That�s right (Jimin laughs)
Jungkook: That�s why Jimin-hyungs� first practice was �Why do you call me?�
Jin and Jimin: (Sings) �Why do you call me, why do you call me, tee de de de�

RM: At that time, that was then and now is now. I think it�s like our collective idea of an idol. About how we want to live, what we show. We keep throwing out social issue messages. Like even now, our album title is �Love Yourself� too. We don�t make meaningless songs, but doing this seems like we�re acting too, as we�re living our life.

my heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
becomes empty even with the passing breeze
at the end of my play where breakup was a lie
the price that i had to pay came to me
if someone said they would turn back the time for me
would i have been able to be a bit more honest?
the bare face that only i know
the ugly and pathetic old friends within me
would you still be able to love me again like before
with that smile with which you used look at me
stop saying things like forever, forever
after all, the end originally exists
if there's a start, i don't wanna listen to that
words that are too correct or too much consolation.. i don't wanna listen to that
i was just so scared
because it seemed like perhaps i had never loved you at all
although it was late, that you were true
that only you loved me
more

you're my tear
you're my, you’re my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
what more can i say?
you're my tear

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead
so that pain and regret, none of that would be left

you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my fear
you're my, you're my fear
what more can i say?
you're my...

goodbyes are t.e.a.r
because things like tears are a luxury
there's no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
so just begin now
woo take it easy, slowly carve out my heart
that's right, that’s right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
so that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
that's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
this is the ending you were wishing for
so go on and kill me without hesitating
woo yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
so not even the ashes remain

this is the real you and this is the real me
now we've seen the end and not even resentment is left
i've woken up from the sweet dream and i close my eyes
this is the real you and this is the real me

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead
so that pain and regret, none of that would be left

you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my fear
you're my, you're my fear
what more can i say?
you're my...

what should i say?
we know
the answer is fixed
but replying is always hard

why are you spilling it?
why are you tearing it up?
it's useless, to me
goodbye to me is only those moments (flashback)
the moment you say words from your mouth
the moment our focus becomes irregular
at the moment where everything is dangerous
our end that two letters handed to us
that i won't cry, that i won't tear it up
i can't say those kinds of words. in the future i, too
breakup, incurable disease
you're my beginning and my end, that is all
my meeting and my farewell
you were everything, step forward fear
it will be repeated, caused by you

she seemed flustered as she stared at the diary she once believed she lost. within every turned page were the movies she liked, the places she wanted to go, the flowers she preferred, and the future she hoped for. i had done this for her. “i’m sorry,” never came easy for me. the diary acted as a starting and stopping spot for us.
i wanted to make her happy. i wanted to make her laugh. i wanted to be a good person. i thought that following the words from the diary would help me do so. but that’s not how it worked. the more i tried to be someone else the more frightened i became. wouldn’t my real self be discovered? wouldn’t she be disappointed and leave me? desperately, i hid and turned away from myself. but just like how a person can’t end a sentence without it being complete, the me who i lost couldn’t improve and instead wandered around the same places.
i know now that the me that is incapable and makes mistakes and fails is still a part of myself. no matter how terrible things become, only by being true to myself can i continue to move forward. i stood up and she didn’t stop me.
i left onto the street and took my hat off. as i swept my hair back, all the hours i spent trying to mold myself into someone else slipped through my fingers. i lifted my head and looked at my reflection in the window. staring back at me were pale lips, a frail face, thin shoulders. i looked wretched. i laughed. my reflection laughed too.

a lone flowerpot rested on the storage room’s window. i didn’t know where it came from. which of my dongsaeng brought it? i took out my phone. the classroom was always dark with shadows since there wasn’t any electricity, but i could still distinguish green leaves from the pale light coming from the windows. the photo i took on my phone didn’t come out good, and it wasn’t because i simply took it with a phone. i pondered this often - how a photo never captures what eyes can.
i noticed an ‘h’ written below the flowerpot when i approached. when i lifted it up i read ‘hoseok’s flowerpot.’ i laughed. hoseok was the only dongsaeng who’d bring a flowerpot here. i placed it back on the windowsill so only the ‘h’ is visible again. i then looked around. i didn’t notice this before, but the windowsill was covered with scattered writing. the walls and ceiling were covered in it too. “pass or die,” the names of unrequited love, dates, and countless names that had become worn and illegible.
this classroom hadn’t always been a storage room. students used to filter it every day. it’d be filled when school began and emptied during vacations. were there students like us? would they receive punishments for being late and missing class? were there mercilessly violent teachers and never ending exams and coursework? were there teachers who’d tell principals about their students and their friends?
i wondered whether my father’s name lied among the words. the school was my father’s alma mater. he was someone who believed attending the same schools maintained a family’s dignity. i read over the names and found my father’s. it was in the middle of the left wall surrounded by other names. a quote was written underneath it, “everything started here.”

it was april 11th again when my eyes opened. sunlight shined through the open curtain. i was overwhelmed with vertigo when i stood up. i had to close my eyes. when i did this, my surroundings morphed into a red afterimage, and i saw taehyung. he was standing alone on top of the observation platform at the sea. that happened on may 22nd. it was the past and the future. it was something that’d happened already and something that still had the chance to happen again. it was then that i thought everything had finally been fixed.
i watched taehyung climb to the top of the platform as the sun began to set. the sky was still blue, but it was slowly blooming into red. i saw taehyung climbing when i lifted my head. he reached the top after a few moments and looked down at us. then he jumped. he leapt as if he had the wings of a bird, and for a few seconds it seemed as if he froze in the air. something overcame me the way a mirror breaks, the way cold air blows in from an open window.
when my eyes opened again it was today, april 11th.

what was the reason that that particular melody became stuck in my head only after i lost the person i’d practice it with? i glanced at the piano across the room as i reclined on the couch. when i was expelled i threw away the piano key that belonged to my mother - the only thing i'd salvaged from the ruins of my burned house. the piano key half burned itself. i threw it out of my apartment’s window. i thought doing so would end it. i repeated to myself, like i had all those years ago, that i’d never lay my hands on a piano again.
early the next day, i hurried down the stairs unable to wait for the elevator. i thought i’d fallen asleep abruptly, but the sun had risen already. the things i did the night before suddenly flooded my thoughts. the flowerbed outside the window was vacant. when i asked the security guard he told me that the garbage truck had already came, and that’s how i lost my mother’s piano key.
i continued to give up on music after that countless times. i won’t do it. i won’t come back. music is nothing. but even when i ran away, i knew. i knew that i’d return to music. the same why i’d stumbled down that staircase, music was the kind of thing i’d never be able to let go of. internally, i was just as free as i was a person who was suffering. i was confused, but i was also lucid. fear and confidence, hope and despair - i lived between those contrasting emotions.
suddenly, i was overcome with the desire to play the piano. i wanted to recognize the me who had pretended to be strong despite the reality that i was a fearful coward. i wanted to pour the curses and make fractures and inflict wounds and hit and destroy and hold and cry. but i didn’t want to run away. i wanted to finish the melody from the piano that frequented my mind every day. for once, it seemed like i could.

i kept walking with the acknowledgement that jungkook was following me. containers continued to appear when i reached the train tracks. it was the fourth container from the back. hoseok mentioned having plans to meet namjoon and taehyung. he told me to join them. i said i would, but i didn’t really plan to attend. i hated being attached to other people, and hoseok knew that. he probably didn’t expect i’d stay true to my word.
when i pulled the door open, hoseok stared at me shocked. when he saw jungkook behind me an exaggerated expression of mixed emotion drew across his face. i pushed past both of them and strolled to the container. “how long has it been?” i could hear hoseok trying to pull jungkook, who was shy, in.
namjoon and taehyung entered. a side of taehyung’s shirt was ripped. when questioned about it, namjoon pretended to hit taehyung with his knuckles. “this kid’s late because he got caught by some cops doing graffiti and i had to go pick him up.” taehyung made a melodramatic apologetic face and explained that his shirt had been ripped in the process of running away.
i sat in the corner and watched them. namjoon gave taehyung a new shirt to change into, and hoseok pulled out hamburgers and beverages. in the midst of everything, jungkook stood awkwardly. he stood as if he hadn’t any idea what to do.  in retrospect, it’s exactly how he acted in high school. hoseok would noisily move around while jungkook hovered around him unsure of what to do.
how long had it been since we met like this? i couldn’t remember. what happened to seokjin hyung and jimin? an uncharacteristic thought crossed my mind. this was the place i’d visited for the first time while my heart was lost somewhere else.

the sheet was immediately engulfed in flames. the pile of objects lost their identities among the intense heat. i couldn't smell the rotting mold nor feel the overbearing humidity nor see the dark light. the only thing left was pain - the pain of the flames, the pain of my fingers blistering. it was only among the fire that my father’s emotionless expression and the sound of music relented.
i was very different from my father. he didn’t understand me and i didn’t understand him. could i have changed his mind if i tried? probably not. all i could do for him was run and hide and defy. it occasionally occurred to me that it wasn’t my father that i was escaping. but if it wasn’t him, what was it? fear settled in for a moment. what was i running from? what ends did i have to go to to be free? it all felt impossible.
it felt like i could hear someone calling, but i didn’t look away from the dancing flames. i couldn’t breathe. i don’t know if it was the smoke or the pain. i didn’t have the power to move anymore. despite this, i knew it was jungkook’s voice that was calling. he must’ve been upset and angry. maybe he’d feel bad for me. i just wanted to disappear. i wanted the smoke and heat, just everything, to end. jungkook shouted something again, but i couldn’t hear it. my gaze fell. when i looked up again i saw the sight of a dirty room in a dirtier world. during what i thought would be my last moments, i saw red flames, endless smoke, and jungkook’s panicked face.

i lifted my head from scanning the magazine advertisements. a different face had been occupying the window seat of the library across from me for the past few days. the heavy book, large bag, and paper cup were the same, but it wasn’t her. i looked back down at the magazine. i was reading the same page over and over again for an hour. my eyes weren’t processing the words at all. why was i still here? i couldn’t fabricate an answer. among people who were absorbed in their own worlds, i was carelessly reading the same page of a magazine. i felt impatient, as if something was supposed to start, but i knew nothing would happen.
i brought the magazine back and strolled between bookshelves. they were taller than i was, filled to the brim with books. an open window breeze carried the library’s scent in the air. i reminisced my highschool years. the books i read in the company of my friends in that storage room had the same scent. had the present me grown from the old me at all? i couldn’t bring myself to be positive. it could’ve been because everything seemed to be frozen back then. i moved to a different bookshelf and picked an old book i studied from high school. i had to start over. i had to give everything up one at a time.

i knew something was going on with taehyung for a long time. although he pretended that nothing was wrong, his momentary anxieties gave it away. the fact that he didn’t know how to handle it made it all the more obvious to me. he was in and out of the police station. he had wounds all over his body. he had nightmares.
i never pressed on the issue because i was waiting for taehyung to bring it up himself. the reason i never confronted him was also because i doubted my own to right to hear about it. i wanted to be a hyung, an adult. but in the end it all comes to the simple fact that i couldn’t help my friends when they were struggling. they praised me for being all grown up, but i wasn’t really an adult. faced with problems, i could only hesitate and ignore the reality before me.
yoongi hyung died - taehyung had that nightmare again today. i had to shake him from his sleep. he sat in silence for a long time staring into space. he didn’t wipe his tears and he mumbled incoherent things. he mumbled about yoongi dying and jungkook getting in an accident and me being caught up in a fight. he said that he dreamed of those types of things everyday - that the traumas were so clear that they seemed real. “hyung, don’t go anywhere.”

i finished pumping gas. i begun returning to the shop. something brushed against my face and fell. stepping back, a crumbled bill settled at my feet. out of reflex, i reached down. the random people in the car laughed, and i stopped reaching down. seokjin hyung watched me from a distance. i couldn’t raise my head. what are you supposed to do when you make eye contact with people who drive expensive cars and ridicule others? you confront them. if you believe they’re doing something unjust then you have to confront them. it’s not a matter of pride or bravery or equality. it’s something that you just have to do.
but i was a part-time worker at a gas station. if a customer threw trash i had to clean it up. if they cussed me out i had to listen. if they threw a bill at my feet i had to pick it up. my body shook with humiliation. i dug my fingernails into my palm.
at that moment, someone’s hand reached down and picked up the bill. the car filled with people left as if the fun was over. i couldn’t look up even after they were gone. i didn’t have the courage to look seokjin hyung in the eyes. it wasn't like he didn’t know about my cowardliness, my poverty, my situation, but i still didn’t want him to witness it. hyung stood at the end of my gaze. he didn’t move. he didn’t approach. he didn’t speak.

jimin and she stood in the middle of the practice studio. the starting pose seemed endless. when the music flowed from the speaker, they begun the choreography i practiced with her not that long ago. i watched from my place on the floor.
when i first discovered that my ankle momentary prevented me from dancing, it’d been hard to swallow. it was stifling to simply watch other’s dance. but overtime, as i taught and helped jimin improve, i realized that not being able to dance wasn’t that big of a deal. i could continue to be happy other ways.
i couldn’t let even the smallest of mistake go overlooked when i helped jimin. when he made a movement smaller or more subdued, i’d stop him and examine each movement individually. but when i returned to my place on the floor, almost like an audience for jimin, i realized that jimin’s dancing was bigger that just the step to step movements. i viewed what i originally recognized as mistakes differently. the trivial mistakes and imperfections contributed  to something greater, something unique. it was different than my own dancing, but jimin had his own timing and his own expression. his dancing was bight and heartwarming on its own.
when the music ended, jimin’s dance did too. his face glowed with excitement and happiness. she stood next to him. she’d be going overseas soon. we locked eyes. she didn’t look like my mother at all because i couldn’t remember my mother’s face. so why did i see my mother in her? my heart began to ache, and the pain in my ankle intensified.

i liked being around people. when i was still at the orphanage i worked at a fast food chain and was exposed to a lot of people. i’d always laugh and be cheerful. i liked that job. with my experience of being exposed to more bad than good, it was evident that i had few reasons to laugh and be cheerful. perhaps that’s why i enjoyed the job so much. it gave me the opportunity to laugh and smile and be happy. what does it matter if it was usually forced? overtime i could trick myself into believing that it was all real. my mood became better when i let myself laugh and by treating people kindly i became a kinder person. there were hard days, like always, and sometimes taking a step forward would be too overwhelming. but even so, it was easier back then to withstand the hard days because i had friends. things aren’t the same now.
sometimes i remembered my friends when i looked at the store of customers. seokjin hyung, who transferred in, namjoon, who disappeared one day, yoongi, who wouldn’t answer calls anymore, taehyung, whose whereabouts we weren’t sure of, and jimin, who never returned after he went to the emergency room. i’d seen jungkook in his school uniform through the window a few times, but he never frequented the store anymore. perhaps those times had passed.
i heard the sound of a customer entering. with a cheerful smile, i greeted them.

i opened the emergency exit door and rushed down the staircase. my heart felt like it was going to explode. i swore i glimpsed the clear face of my mother in the hospital hallway. when i looked back, people from the opened elevator doors distorted my vision. i pushed through the people and followed where i’d seen my mother leaving through the emergency exit. without rest and with an anxious heart, i ran down the stairs two at a time.
“mom!” my mother ceased her walking. she turned around. i ran down another flight. her face became visible. it was then that i lost my balance and my center of gravity fell forward. i closed my eyes, but a person’s hand reached out and held onto my arm. when i looked back at my savior, jimin stared at me with a shocked expression. before i could thank him, i turned my head.
there was a woman with a surprised face. a young boy stood next to her with wide, unblinking eyes. the woman wasn’t my mother. i remained at the top of the staircase staring at her blankly.
i didn’t remember how i got out of that situation. i didn’t ask how jimin had managed to catch my fall either. my mind couldn’t focus on such trivial details. the woman wasn’t my mother, and somewhere deep down i knew that from the start. it’s been more than 10 years since she left me alone in that theme park. she’d be older now. if i met her, i wouldn’t recognize her by now. i could barely even remember how she looked all those years ago.
when i glanced behind me, jimin was following me quietly. back in highschool, jimin told me that he had stayed in the hospital after being in the emergency room. i thought about how he looked at me, unsure of how to respond to the inquiry of whether he wanted to leave the hospital. was jimin trapped the same way i was, incapable of both holding on and letting go of old memories? i took a step toward him.
“jimin-ah. let’s get out of here.”

i was stuck in the practice studio again. it was late and the train stopped running. to be honest, i had waited for it to stop so i could practice alone and obsess over my imperfections. i was restless. i was scared. but it was something i wanted to do, and so i stayed in that room overnight.
overtime, my fear in my heart began to evaporate. only the fun air of dancing persisted. for the longest time, i believed that the weak, small, powerfless me i imagined was real. when i danced i could only think of my own weight or the length of my body or my speed or my strength. however, the me who danced wasn’t small nor weak. my stuttering movements became more fluid and i improved. i grew the way fingernails do. slowly. i realized that i was actually an expressive person. i felt this way when i danced, like i was saying everything i couldn’t. when i started to dance i, for the first time, started to like myself.

hoseok hyung lived in a rooftop apartment at the end of a narrow alley. it was very high. when i visited the one room apartment he’d brag about how it was the highest room in the city. he bragged that he could see everything, every place, from his rooftop room. from the window we could see the trains and the train tracks and the containers. namjoon hyung lived in one of those. if i moved my gaze down a little i could see the school we all used to attend.
after locating the school, i drew my gaze to the opposite side of the city. a line of apartments rested at the bottom of the mountain. there was my - no - my parent’s house. they were looking for me. when i ran away from the hospital without a word they were contacted. i didn’t have the confidence to face them. i couldn’t go home yet. that didn’t mean i wanted to return to the hospital, but i had nowhere to go and no money. hyung had told me to follow him, and he lead me here - hyung’s house.
i looked back to the apartment buildings. i had to return eventually. i had to tell my parents i wasn’t going back to the hospital. i inhaled sharply and then slowly exhaled. it felt like the mere thought could trigger another seizure. i didn’t trust myself anywhere other than at the hospital. i could be rushed there again. i was so afraid. i couldn’t stand it.

hoseok hyung stood next to me when i opened my eyes. an all too familiar ceiling looked down at me with a familiar darkness. i tried to sit up, but he put his finger up to his lips. everyone was sleeping. the room was quiet. hyung offered me a new shirt, and jerked his head toward the exit of the hospital.
“we all came together.”  he said that namjoon hyung was keeping guard while yoongi hyung was buying time talking with the nurses. jungkook and taehyung would meet us at the elevator. hyung reached out a hand when he saw my confused expression. i was still in a daze.
i’d dreamed of the day i’d leave the hospital sometimes. i wanted to leave and see my friends so i could spend time with them and laugh and talk the way we did before, but now i didn’t know. was it actually a good idea to leave? my parents hid me here and buried my existence. people whispered that i had a mental illness. i didn’t know if hoseok hyung viewed me the same way. maybe he thought i was strange. maybe i made him uncomfortable.
“come on. we’re running out of time.” the clock’s second hand sound seemed unconventionally fast because of hyung’s words. the sound of footsteps, like an auditory hallucination, came closer to the hospital room. hyung and i looked toward the door and then at each other. he never let his hand leave me.

when i turned around, i discovered small letters written below the ‘x’ that spelled out short sentences. one said “it isn’t my fault.” it was her. i hadn’t seen her myself and i didn’t know her handwriting, but i knew. it seemed like a last goodbye, saying that it wasn’t my fault she left, saying that this didn’t happen because i was a bad person, saying that i shouldn’t blame or torment myself, saying that i should be brave.
when i came to my senses i was back at my house. i could hear noona’s scream from behind the door. i flung it open and a familiar scene was laid out. i moved to block noona from my father and i grabbed him. i looked him in the eyes and at first he seemed surprised. but then he swung. it knocked me out for a second. this wasn’t the first time that sort of thing happened. noona’s crying grew louder. my chin ached and the smell of rust stained my mouth. but i didn’t stop. i grabbed my father by his waist and he angrily yelled. he beat my shoulders and back relentlessly. i only held on tighter.
it wasn’t that i didn’t feel the pain. it wasn’t that i wasn’t scared. it was the understanding that if i let go, this same daily cycle of pain and suffering would repeat. i wanted things to change.
no. i’m not like my father. i’m going to protect our family. something he couldn’t do.

“hyung, is that all? you aren’t hiding anything else from us?” our surroundings became quiet simultaneously. everyone’s eyes were on me. i looked at seokjin hyung. he looked back at me. his eyes were full of exhaustion and pity. somebody grabbed my arm and stopped me before i could press the issue again. i didn’t have to look to know it was namjoon hyung.
“what does it have to do with you? you aren’t my real brother.” i could feel namjoon’s stare. i shook off his hand without lifting my head. i knew that i was angry at him for no reason. i repeated the words i heard hyung use on the phone - that i was angry, that i was upset. his words weren’t incorrect. i was a year younger than him. i wasn’t his brother. it was true that i should take care of myself, but i was still upset. i was angrier than i could put into words. i hoped he’d understand.
“taehyung-ah i’m sorry. let’s stop talking about this.” it was seokjin hyung who said this. it was seokjin hyung who called my name. it was seokjin hyung who apologized. namjoon hyung didn’t do anything. “what do you mean stop? since it’s come up, why don’t we talk about everything. you have something else you’re hiding.”
“let’s talk outside.” namjoon hyung replied holding onto my arm again. he dragged me out before i could shake him off. “let me go. what right do you have to stop me? what do you know, hyung? you don’t know anything. you just think he’s this great guy, right?” he let go of my arm after that. i stumbled at the release. no, it wasn’t just him letting me go that made me stumble. when he released my arm, it felt as if everything that had sustained me for so long crumbled. perhaps i hoped he’d never let go, that he’d get angry and drag me out the way he did. perhaps i hoped he’d scold me like a real brother, like someone close and precious.
but hyung let go of my arm, and i could only laugh. “what’s so special about being together? what are we to each other? we’re all alone in the end.” that was the moment seokjin hyung hit me.

the gas station worker spat on the ground when he left, and i sprawled my body on the ground again. i’d been caught spraying graffiti on the wall of the gas station, and the owner hit me while asking what i thought i was doing drawing on someone’s wall. i rolled on the ground. getting beaten was something i was used to.
i started graffiti a long time ago when i found a discarded spray can someone left behind. i think it was yellow. i sprayed it around and stared at the paint. it was a bright yellow against the grey wall. for a while, i mindlessly painted like that, and i only stopped when i ran out of paint. i threw it away and stepped back to examine my work. i felt out of breath at the sight.
i didn’t know what it meant. i didn’t know what the designs and colors stood for or what i’d done or why i did it. but i did it, and so i concluded that it was an expression of my feelings stained on the wall. i’d spewed my heart out, and at first i thought the drawing was ugly. for a moment, i wanted to erase it from the wall. however, instead of erasing it i caked on other colors and other shapes and other designs. i sat against it when i was done. it didn’t matter whether i liked it or not. it didn’t matter whether it was beautiful or not. it was me.
i coughed when i rose to my feet. when i hunched over and spat out blood, i saw someone’s hand reach down to pick up the spray can. it was namjoon hyung. i chuckled. i thought he was some sort of ghost. he reached out his hand, and i simply looked back up at him. hyung took my hand and helped me stand up properly. his hand was warm.

when i looked back, the hospital was a faraway place. i couldn’t see the bench i left those wildflowers nor the window i looked out with her anymore. she was a space that let me breathe in the stuffy atmosphere of the hospital. we’d sit on that bench and talk about everything until the sun would set. i talked about playing in the hideout and vacations i took to the beach and walking to the train station. she told me about the corners of the hospital and which window you could watch the river from and the which staircase secretly led to the roof. there wasn’t anything she didn’t know about that hospital.
her room was empty because she was discharged. or did she move to a different hospital? i asked the nurses, but they said it was confidential. a corner of my soul felt empty. when i turned around and started walking i could see the school. it seemed that everything i ever told her about myself had something to do with the hyungs. every story i told incorporated them in some way. for the lonelier part of me, the hyungs had become my friends, family, and teachers. my story was intertwined with theirs, and i only existed within them.
at some point it occured to me there may come a time after my time spent with them. one day i may go looking only to discover that they’d be gone. or maybe something else could happen. i didn’t know.
i thought about that night, when the moon ascended in the sky, the world turned upside down, the headlamps inverted on themselves, the car passed me and then disappeared, the sound of the engine. it was familiar for some reason. i didn’t want to jump to conclusions, but i still kept thinking about that moment.

“hyungs. what do you dream about?” the hyungs looked back at me in response to my question. “i have to write a paper about future hopes.” i elaborated. seokjin hyung opened his mouth and said, “i don’t think i have a dream. if i have something i hope for, it’s just to the extent of… wanting to become a good person?” he cut himself off, seeming embarrassed. then yoongi hyung, who was at the piano, spoke in an airy voice. “it’s okay to not have a dream. i don’t have one. i’m just going to become whatever.” everyone burst out at his words. they fit him well.
“i’m going to become a superhero and save the world from bad guys.” taehyung said this while standing on his chair to pose. he reached his arms toward the sky. hoseok hyung scolded him telling him to get down before he got hurt. hoseok hyung then added, “i want to find my mom and live happily. being happy is my dream.” hyung smiled as he spoke. “does that mean you’re unhappy now?” jimin asked. hoseok hyung replied, “when i was in preschool i wanted to be president, but i didn’t have anything i wanted to be after that.”
only namjoon hyung was left after that. after feeling everyone’s eyes on him, he shrugged. “i want to say something nice, but i don’t really have a dream either. i just wish my part-time job paid more.” i nodded and stared down at the paper in front of me. the paper was divided into spaces for students and spaces for parents. what did i want to become? i couldn’t think of anything to write.

i walked down the rooftop railing of an abandoned building. when i lifted my leg, my foot was shadowed by the darkness bubbling below. the night of the city was spread out underneath my feet. neon signs, honking horns, and dust was scattered around in the dark. for a moment i felt dizzy from vertigo. i stretched my arms out to balance myself. then i thought about it. it would only take one wrong step. it’d only take one step to end everything. i leaned toward the darkness and it spread from my foot and up my leg. my breathing stopped when i leaned further. my mind was void of any thoughts. nothing. no one. i didn’t want to leave anything behind, but i couldn’t remember anything. this was the end.
it was then that my phone began to ring. clarity washed over me as if i’d awoken from a dream. my subdued senses returned, and i pulled out my phone. it was yoongi hyung.",FALSE,FALSE,,BTS,FALSE,KOR,FALSE

goodbyes are t.e.a.r
because things like tears are a luxury
there's no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
so just begin now
woo take it easy, slowly carve out my heart
that's right, that’s right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
so that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
that's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
this is the ending you were wishing for
so go on and kill me without hesitating
woo yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
so not even the ashes remain

this is the real you and this is the real me
now we've seen the end and not even resentment is left
i've woken up from the sweet dream and i close my eyes
this is the real you and this is the real me

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead
so that pain and regret, none of that would be left

no matter how old i get, i will keep coming back with more love for everyone. i may not be much, but please let me be your pride and joy. i will strive to remain your awesome son, grandson, friend, younger brother, and an older brother who makes you proud

time goes by so diligently. even when everything else comes to a stop, time does not. it keeps going. this is our record that has finally seen light after such a long period. these are the memoirs of our footsteps past. these are the sounds that are frozen in space. and as special as the year 2020 is on its own, i am thrilled to be putting down the seven of our names on the album, with no other words to describe us
every time an album is released, i tend to get emotional. nonetheless, i am grateful that the seven of us have reached a new stage. we’ve passed through countless dimensions and probabilities to get here. i am thankful that this book has come to be. i am honored to be holding on to this much luck. thank you
i know better now though — that the seven of us are not the only ones standing on the empty stage in the dark. i now see the silhouettes of everyone who has been here with us throughout our history. some of them are tucked low, some are hanging unreachably high. i must say, that is what i’ve learned after 7 years of running toward the truth
i still don’t know all the names of those to whom i owe thanks. i probably can’t even write them all down. but i know that these names belong to my family, friends, the members, the agency, all the staff members and associates in the industry, and even to a brief message of encouragement from an unknown face. we all wear different name tags when we meet at different points in our lives, but i know that at this moment, i am able to smile and write this thank you note because of everyone who treated me with love when they crossed paths with me
i know though, there is one final name that deserves to be at the end of this short story. and that name would belong to armys. when i read out the word army, it sounds korean, but at times it also sounds english. sometimes it even sounds spanish. on that name tag, i see the names and faces of all armys around this planet. i fall asleep embracing these names that have come pouring into my arms like falling stars. i shall have a good dream — and i shall find a good vibe to keep going. would this not be what true love looks like? i love you all. thank you. here’s to another record of us

while being able to make an album and have people listen to our songs is a precious and happy thing, i’m always thinking of how to make more heartfelt songs that can touch all those that listen to our songs. it is because of this that making an album has a big meaning for us. i want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the efforts and work of the people that helped us create this album
i know that words are not enough to express how thankful i am to bang pd, yoon seok jun and the rest of the big hit entertainment family. i want to show you how much more we can grow just like how much we have grown so far. i am deeply thankful
i am also so sorry and thankful to all the staff and the design team. you sleep less and work harder than us and i know i don’t express myself enough. it is because of your efforts that we are able to shine brightly. thank you from the bottom of my heart
to my members. just thank you. i know i shouldn’t take you all for granted but i keep thinking it’s just natural. i can’t imagine not having all of you. so i hope to continue going forward with all of you for a long, long time. i will try my best to do better. thank you so much and i love you
to army. it’s already been 7 years since we’ve been together. i think we’ve been able to share a lot of happy emotions together by talking about music. although there is happiness that comes from simply being happy, i think happiness that is earned through sharing our feelings is something i am truly grateful for. it is a blessing that i was able to meet all of you. i’m really curious to see how many more precious memories we will have together as the years go by. until then, i hope to continue to share this with my members and all of you. lastly, as i said before, having people listen to our music is our biggest happiness. i know i always say this but the reason we exist and are able to sing on stage is because of all you. thank you. i love you

another full album has been released. first of all, i’d like to share this honor with our army. if it weren’t for all of you, there would be no meaning of us making music. thank you and i love you army
much love to my family who is always by my side and giving me strength
and to the big hit family. now there is more staff that i don’t know that i do know but i will never forget the efforts and work of all our staff. i am happy to be able to work with the world’s best staff
to the bts members. preparing for this album was hard work and i’m glad that all our efforts weren’t wasted because we were able to complete a really amazing album. i am happy to have worked with all of you for this album. let’s promote this album well~
i also want to say thank you to all the people who listen to our music. i believe that music that doesn’t have people listening to it is incomplete music. thank you for completing our album",FALSE,FALSE,,BTS,FALSE,KOR,FALSE

to me of yesterday
to the life of giving up
i let myself go away
but in this world, you know
there are truths unchanged
time rushes ever forward
there's no ifs, buts, or maybes
almost forgotten memories return
touch of the devil, fateful recall
i still wonder, why did they beckon again
every day ask me, guess it, whip it, repeat oh
nothing that will change, so
i lock it up again, close
‘how much love? how much joy?’
soothe myself and stay calm, alone

yeah i don't care, it's all
choices by my fate, so we're here
look ahead, the way is shinin'
keep goin' now

blaming my dream, asking why i live and breathe
oh my god (god, god, god)
uh time goes by
seven years of anguish come out finally
oppressions all resolved
into my heart come answers from my most trusted
‘only one hope, only one soul’
‘only one smile, only one you’
definite answer to the truth of the world
only one and unchanging me, right

Ah, ah
One day, the world stopped
Without any warning
Spring didn't know that it had to wait
Showed up not even a minute late
Streets erased all of footprints
I lie here, fallen to the ground
Time goes by on its own
Without a single apology
It looks like it's going to rain again today
I'm soaked to the bone
Still won't stop
Running faster than that cloud of rain
Thought that would be enough
Guess I'm only human after all

Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind
Dancing off-beat lying on the ground

Nothing has changed

Landing over the bed
This is the safest place
Somehow there's no joy, no sadness, no emotion

It hugs me
They greet me again

Someone come and save me, please

I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The meaning of the tears reflected in the mirror
My color hidden with a smile, blue and grey
I don't know where it went wrong
Since my youth, I've had a blue question mark in my head
Maybe that's why I've been living so fiercely
But when I look back, I'm all by myself
That hazy shadow that swallows me up
The blue question mark still exists
Is it anxiety or depression?
How am I so regretful?
Or is it just me, one that loneliness gave birth to

I still feel it

On the road I always walk
There is a light that always shines
But today, the scene feels unfamiliar
Is it dull or is it broken?
This lump of metal feels heavy
A grey rhino is approaching
I'm just standing there without focus
I don't feel like myself at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in a God called conviction
Words like color make me cringe
A vast grey area is way more comfortable
Hundreds of millions of grey facial expressions here
When it rains, it's my world
I dance over this city
On a clear day, bring some fog
On rainy days, we're always together
A toast to all the dust here
I just wanna be happier
Please feel the warmth of my hands
They're not warm, so I need you more
